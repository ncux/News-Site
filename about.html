                        My current laptop has a broken screen and is being repaired but I won't have it back for a while.
                        I have submissions for university work in about a week and I need a laptop.

                        It doesn't have to be good, just be able to access YouTube, Google docs and that's really the only requirement. Windows or Chrome OS would be fine.

                        Only issue is I'm completely broke so my budget is like £40 or $55.

                        Any recommendations on what I can do? I'm extremely desperate so any suggestion I'm open to
                    </p> <br>

                    <p>
                        Considering you’ll be getting your laptop back why haven’t you looked into a rental option via your university?

                        My university (state level in the USA) let me rent out a laptop a week at a time for free which could be
                        renewed at the end of the week. You just have to have all your files and what not either stored in the cloud or on a thumb drive.

                        She said the guns were purchased in December last year.

                        "While work is being done as to the chain of events that lead to both the holding of this gun licence and the possession of these weapons,
                        I can tell you one thing right now; our gun laws will change."

                        She said there had been attempts to change New Zealand's gun laws in 2005, 2012 and after an inquiry in 2017.

                        "Now is the time for change."

                        It's quite bizarre in the details, beyond the extremity of the act itself. All the memory, the stated intent of the manifesto -
                        whether it's possible to take seriously or not - this feels like something uniquely born of the times. It almost seems like this guy comes from the internet more than any geographical location.

                        Full disclosure, I'm Australian and I'm not trying to minimise his citizenship in any way or whatever.

                    It did seem extremely suspicious when her exes came out of the woodwork to talk about her abusive, erratic behavior,
                    while his exes were saying he never abused them and was a decent guy.
                    She'd even joked herself before in interviews about how crazy she is when in a relationship and how she was known to react violently.

                    I destroyed my relationship by pushing my now ex-girlfriend into the hotwife fetish.
                    I'm not looking for sympathy or justification because I don't deserve any.
