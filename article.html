                    I'm a fan of the URL – specifically, query parameters. Using them allows us to improve UX by making links reentrant such that they can be shared, bookmarked, refreshed etc.

                    In most cases what I needed to do in my work was somehow encode the state of form control components (a search bar, filter dropdown, …) on the
                    URL and keep them in sync. Some day last year I thought to myself: this requires a lot of boilerplate, why isn't there a better way to do it?

                    Unable to find a solution suitable to me, I had a rough idea of writing a reusable solution. The final breakthrough was the idea of imitating the Reactive Forms API: it's declarative,
                    simple and powerful. And doing this would mean Angular developers should be immediately familiar with this library as well. So that's what I did!

                    Of course this isn't it – it comes with a lot of features to control how to (de-)serialize values, debounce parameters, default values, work with arrays, …

                    It's been a lot of work, but also a lot of fun. I'd love for people to check it out, try it out, send me feedback, ideas, contribute. Thanks!

                    My computer was loud with fan noise overnight.

                    It wasn't doing anything much in particular, other than keeping some tabs and other programs open, but it apparently ran out of system memory.

                    How can I go about figuring out how this happened, and how it works?

                    That reminds me. Whenever I feed my chickens; I have some chickens, did I ever tell you that? Yeah, I bought some chickens and built a coop for them.
                    Chickens are something else, man. They’re descendants of dinosaurs, did you know that? Just look at the way they walk. And something about them, the way they just stare at you...

                    What was I talking about, Jamie? Oh yeah, whenever I feed my chickens they go fuckin CRAZY . It’s that reptile part of their brain. Jamie, go to my Instagram.
                    I posted this video of my chickens like 2 weeks ago.

                    No, not that one, but this is a pretty cool one too. Did you know that cuckoo birds will invade another birds nest? It’s fucked up.

                    It's quite bizarre in the details, beyond the extremity of the act itself. All the memory, the stated intent of the manifesto -
                    whether it's possible to take seriously or not - this feels like something uniquely born of the times. It almost seems like this guy comes from the internet more than any geographical location.

                    Full disclosure, I'm Australian and I'm not trying to minimise his citizenship in any way or whatever.

                It did seem extremely suspicious when her exes came out of the woodwork to talk about her abusive, erratic behavior,
                while his exes were saying he never abused them and was a decent guy.
                She'd even joked herself before in interviews about how crazy she is when in a relationship and how she was known to react violently.

                I destroyed my relationship by pushing my now ex-girlfriend into the hotwife fetish.
                I'm not looking for sympathy or justification because I don't deserve any.
