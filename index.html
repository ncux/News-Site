                        I have an unusual tablet running 7.1 without Google Play services or the play store, and I would like to add them.

                        I have installed an older version of services without issue (side-loading off USB). If I then install the Play Store app, and launch, the play store crashes after a moment.

                        Are there any other pieces that I need? Do either of these these to be paired to matching versions to work?

                        <p>
                            One of my very best friends has this cancer. He was on the verge of a penectomy. The fact the doctor wants to schedule this surgery means this is REALLY REALLY bad because
                            they will do absolutely anything they can before turning to that. My friend had 14 surgeries to his penis in the first 6 months alone trying to avoid a penectomy.
                            He has had many more. He lives in constant fear and pain. He's afraid to be in a relationship because of it, and he's still intact.

                            Yeah I was really shocked by all that as well. Just remember that the majority of the “advice” given here is personal opinions from anonymous internet people.
                            I know some of it is good, but if you are reading this and really need advice- therapy is the way to go.
                            Often asking questions on here will just leave you more confused.

                        These idiots will never know what OP or others have gone through and OP was damaged/hurt not getting to vent any actually feelings.
                        Hes purely been on the defensive.

                    <p> wouldn't install the Play Store. I refused to log into my Google Account on my Essential phone to see if I could live without Google.
                        I installed the ApkPure store from apkpure.com and it even has up to date versions of Google's apps. Works really good.

                            Maybe it's also personal baggage on my end because I've encountered people who have made that kind of statement
                            but ended up having issues that (to me) make that statement inaccurate.
                            Honestly, I'm fine with people having issues. Everyone does.
